# Badass-Drone
Drone project for TCC CS 142 class. Two drones that fly in formation in reaction to each other and the remote control.
We created different methods that feed into each other like individual parts of an engine. This allows for easy debugging and 
allocation of tasks to different members of your team. 
The main parts of the code would be readSensorData(), translateSensorData(), and flightNaviagation(). Looping quickly through those 
methods allows the drone to constantly read and translate sensor data, and fly based on its readings.
